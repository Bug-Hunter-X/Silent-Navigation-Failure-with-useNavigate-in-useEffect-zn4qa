# Silent Navigation Failure with useNavigate in useEffect

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Router v6 where the `useNavigate` hook fails silently when called within a `useEffect` hook before the component has fully mounted.  The problem arises when navigation is attempted before data fetching or state initialization is complete.

## Problem

The provided `bug.js` file showcases the issue. The `navigate` function is called within a `useEffect` hook that fetches data. If the fetch operation takes time or fails, the navigation will not work as expected and no error will be thrown in the console.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file presents a solution.  We introduce a loading state to handle the asynchronous nature of data fetching.  Navigation is only attempted after data has been successfully fetched.  Error handling is added to gracefully manage potential issues during the fetch operation.

This solution ensures that navigation is reliable and doesn't cause unexpected behavior.
