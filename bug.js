In React Router Dom v6, a common error occurs when navigating using the `useNavigate` hook within a component that hasn't fully mounted. This results in the navigation failing silently, with no apparent error messages.  This often happens when the hook is called inside a useEffect hook before the component's state has been fully initialized or data fetching is complete.  For example:

```javascript
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

function MyComponent() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  useEffect(() => {
    //Simulate fetching data.  If the fetch fails or takes time, the navigate will fail silently.
    fetch('/api/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => {
        if(data.error){
          navigate('/error');
        }
        else{
          navigate('/dashboard');
        }
      });
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>Loading...</div>
  );
}
```
